## Notes

After finishing the design of the app, I was having hard time to figure out how to set the constrains. 
I have studied about it how it works and now I have a good understanding of constrains. 

changing the currency was difficult beacuse without changing the setting of the stimulator, I had gotten wrong symbol.
It took me a long time to figure it out beacuse code was correct but it didn't work since the stimulator default setting.

Setting user defaults for customise tips was first time use, so I had to research the syntax and methods.
